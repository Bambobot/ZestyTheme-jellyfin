### Installing

To add theme to Jellyfin, copy the following line to Dashboard > General > Custom CSS:

`@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stpnwf/ZestyTheme@latest/theme.css');`

---

Note: 

 Backdrops need to be enabled in Jellyfin (Settings > Display > Backdrops) for backdrop to display properly.

Disclaimer:

 I am _not_ knowledgeable in CSS, but if the end result looks how I want it to, despite how hacky or messy the code may be, that's still a win in my books... PRs are welcome.
 Theme has only been tested at 1080p, on both the app and the web interface. So it _may_ look broken on 720p, 2K and 4K.
